# Let's Vote

Allows a user to vote in a poll, create polls, and delete polls. A user must sign in to the user's Facebook account before creating or deleting a poll. All users can see the results of the poll in a pie chart.

### Project Goals

Application was completed as a freeCodeCamp [challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-voting-app).

1. User Story: As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.

2. User Story: As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.

3. User Story: As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.

4. User Story: As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.

5. User Story: As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.

6. User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.

7. User Story: As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)

8. User Story: As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
